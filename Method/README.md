# The prediction Problem
## I. Research Question Formulation
### Objective
The main goal of this study is to use machine learning algorithms to forecast global sugar prices. A secondary goal is to identify significant events that affected sugar prices between 1960 and 2022. The study also seeks to assess the causal inference between events that have been identified and variations in sugar prices.
### Significance
It is crucial for producers, merchants, politicians, and other industry stakeholders to comprehend how well machine learning models predict sugar prices. Furthermore, this research is particularly useful since it helps formulate better policies and decision-making by identifying the factors that influence large fluctuations in sugar prices.
## II. Operational Measures
### Variables
- Dependent Variable (Y): Sugar Price
- Independent Variable (X): Time (monthly)
### Data Type
The dataset utilized in this research is time-series data, covering the years from 1960 to 2022. It captures the temporal dynamics of world sugar prices, making it suitable for time-series analysis.
## III. Hypothesis Development
### Hypothesis
Machine learning algorithms can effectively predict sugar prices based on historical time-series data.
### Justification
The premise behind the hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can use past patterns and trends in sugar prices to forecast future prices with accuracy. Also, the transaction policy, financial crisis, and customer demand all influence the fluctuation of the sugar price during history.
### Machine Learning Algorithm Selection
For time-series prediction, the research will explore the use of algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Linear Regression. These algorithms are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in data, which is essential for predicting future time-series values.
## IV. Model Development
### Data Processing
- Delete the data that is not useful.
- Transform the time variable into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
## V. Results Presentation
### Training and Testing
Results will be presented by training the machine learning model on historical data and evaluating its predictive performance on future data. A train-test split will be employed randomly.
### Data Visualization
Visualization techniques, including line plots and annotated time series plots will be used to illustrate the model's ability to predict future sugar prices. Special emphasis will be placed on conveying key insights and patterns identified by the model.
## VI. Model Evaluation
### Evaluation Criteria
The model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Interpretability and explainability of the model will also be considered.
### Iterative Improvement
Continuous model refinement will involve adjusting hyperparameters, experimenting with additional features, and considering alternative algorithms to enhance the predictive accuracy. Regular assessments and feedback loops will be implemented to iteratively improve the model's performance.

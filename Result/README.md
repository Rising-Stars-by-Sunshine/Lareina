-  The model reasonably predicts sugar prices with an RÂ² of 0.695, suggesting that roughly 69.5% of the variance in sugar prices is predictable by the model.
-  The low MSE indicates that the model has a small error magnitude in the context of sugar price predictions.

-  Predictive model confirms that historical sugar prices can be used to forecast future prices with reasonable accuracy and low prediction error.

-  The analysis indicates a definite change in sugar price trends corresponding to the moments when each policy was implemented.
-  The findings support the hypothesis that policy events have a measurable effect on sugar prices.

-  The occurrence of the EC Sugar Regime and the US Embargo on Cuba is associated with significant fluctuations in global sugar prices, validating the suspected causal relationship.
